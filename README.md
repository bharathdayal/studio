# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

Project Summary: Bharath Oriento
This document provides a blueprint of the "Bharath Oriento" application and a summary of the development process.

1. App Blueprint
Overview
"Bharath Oriento" is a responsive web application designed for mobile devices. Its core concept is to offer different utility tools based on the physical orientation of the device. The application's tagline is "Flip the phone, switch the mode."

Core Functionality
The application uses the browser's Screen Orientation API to detect the device's orientation and dynamically renders a corresponding component.

portrait-primary: Displays the Alarm Clock.
landscape-primary: Displays the Stopwatch.
portrait-secondary: Displays the Timer.
landscape-secondary: Displays the Weather widget.
Default/Undetected: A welcome screen is shown, prompting the user to rotate their device.
Key Components
page.tsx: The main entry point of the app. It uses the useOrientation hook to manage which component is displayed. It also includes the main layout and animations.
useOrientation hook: A custom React hook that listens for changes in screen orientation and returns the current state. It includes fallbacks for browsers with limited support for the Screen Orientation API.
AlarmClock: A component that shows the current time and date, updated every second.
Stopwatch: A functional stopwatch with start, pause, and reset capabilities.
Timer: A countdown timer that can be set by the user (in minutes). It uses system toasts to notify when the time is up.
Weather: A component that uses the device's geolocation to fetch and display the current weather conditions, including temperature, a descriptive icon, and wind status. It uses a Genkit AI flow for this.
FeatureCard: A reusable card component used to wrap each of the tools, providing a consistent UI.
Styling and UI
Tech Stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
UI Components: Built using ShadCN UI components.
Color Scheme: A warm "Sunset" theme with a deep orange primary color, a magenta accent, and a soft off-white background.
Fonts: Poppins for headlines and PT Sans for body text.
2. Development Log & Prompts
This section summarizes the key interactions and changes made to the application.

Initial Issue: Blank Screen on iOS

User Prompt: "preview on IOS mobile shows blank white screen"
Action: Identified a potential issue with the useOrientation hook on browsers with incomplete support for the Screen Orientation API. Implemented a fallback mechanism to prevent the app from failing on these devices.
Permission Error Troubleshooting

User Prompt: "Workstation does not exists or your currently signed in account does not have access to it. Permission Denied"
Action: Explained that the error was likely related to the local development environment, which is outside the AI's control. To rule out code issues, the useOrientation hook was further refined to be more robust.
Application Renaming

User Prompt: "Change Orientation Station to Mobile Orientation-BD", followed by "Update application name to Bharath Oriento - 'Flip the phone, switch the mode'."
Action: The application's title and tagline were updated in src/app/layout.tsx and src/app/page.tsx.
UI Color Scheme Update

User Prompt: "How about UI color scheme. Current one is Blue color. Can you show some more UI design," followed by "Yes, Great"
Action: Proposed and implemented a new "Sunset" color theme. The changes were applied to the CSS variables in src/app/globals.css, updating the app's primary, accent, and background colors.
Creation of Project Summary

User Prompt: "Can you create pdf file that has App Blueprint and all prompt responses", followed by "Yes".
Action: Created this Project_Summary.md file to document the application's architecture and the development history.
